The goal is to train a classification model that can predict whether a given mass is malignant or benign based on its features. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new patients by identifying the k-nearest neighbors in the training data and assigning the class label that appears most frequently among these neighbors. For classification, the algorithm identifies the k-nearest neighbors of a new data point and assigns the class label that appears most frequently among these neighbors.
